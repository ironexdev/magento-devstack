# Wrapper project for [Docker Magento](https://github.com/ironexdev/docker-magento#docker-development-environment-for-magento-2)

Use bin/docker to run commands from Docker Magento project - [more info here](https://github.com/ironexdev/docker-magento#docker-development-environment-for-magento-2).

You can create magento and nuxt folders by running commands from Docker Magento project, or create "magento" and "nuxt" submodules and point them to your Magento and VSF 2 or Vue.js projects.

Run those commands using `bin/docker`, which is symlinked to docker subrepository
